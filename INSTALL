Thanks for downloading django-faq.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory::

    python setup.py install

If you have the Python ``pip`` utility available, you can
also type the following to download and install in one step::

    pip install django-faq

Or if you're still using ``easy_install``::

    easy_install django-faq

Or if you’d prefer you can simply place the included ``faq``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you’re working from a
Git checkout.

Note that this application requires Python 2.5 or newer, and a
functional installation of Django 1.2.7 or newer. You can obtain Python
from http://www.python.org/ and Django from
https://www.djangoproject.com/.
